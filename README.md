__Caveat Emptor__

     This is a complete rewrite of my Radium-Codex project. **WORK-IN-PROGRESS**.
     I stridently recommend that you **avoid using this repository** for the time being. 
     There isn't much to see yet.
    
__WORK IS ONGOING AND THE CODE CHANGES FREQUENTLY.__

* COGS is a personal project that evolved from a previous set of projects.
* COGS is a middleware and event-driven architecture.
