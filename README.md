## NOTE: THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN ABANDONED IN FAVOR OF AN ALTERNATE IMPLEMENTATION.
__The COGS Project has evolved into the Noid Project__, based heavily on the lessons learned from this project. Noid is currently under heavy, private development and will be pushed to Github sometime in Nov, 2015. Not that anyone would notice. 

__Caveat Emptor__

     This is a complete rewrite of my Radium-Codex project. **WORK-IN-PROGRESS**.
     I stridently recommend that you **avoid using this repository** for the time being. 
     There isn't much to see yet.
    
__WORK IS ONGOING AND THE CODE CHANGES FREQUENTLY.__

* COGS is a personal project that evolved from a previous set of projects.
* COGS is a middleware and event-driven architecture.
